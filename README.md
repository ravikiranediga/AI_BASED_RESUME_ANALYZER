# 📄 AI Resume Analyzer  
### AI-Powered Resume Screening & Skill Matching System

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
The **AI Resume Analyzer** is an intelligent system that automates resume screening using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**. It extracts key information from resumes, identifies relevant skills, and matches candidates against job descriptions—similar to real-world **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)** used by companies.

This project demonstrates how AI can streamline recruitment by reducing manual effort, improving accuracy, and enabling scalable resume evaluation.
